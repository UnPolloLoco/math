		The limit of a function represents the value which a function <i>approaches</i>, but never reaches. Consider this graph of <kspan><kx class="yellow">f(x)</kx>.</kspan> Even though <kx class="yellow">f(2)</kx> isn't defined, a glance at the graph tells you that <kx class="yellow">f(x)</kx> appears to approach <kx>1</kx> as <kx>x</kx> gets infinitely close to—or <i>approaches</i>—<kspan><kx>2</kx>.</kspan>
	</p>

<p>
	The following equation demonstrates the notation of your average limit. It would be read aloud as "the limit of <kx>f(x)</kx> as <kx>x</kx> approaches <kx>c</kx> is <kspan><kx>L</kx>."</kspan>
</p>

<h2><kx>
	\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) = L
</kx></h2>

<p>
	The limit of the aforementioned graph, as <kx>x</kx> approaches <kspan><kx>2</kx>,</kspan> would be written like so:
</p>

<h2><kx class="yellow">
	\lim\limits_{x \to 2} \frac{x(x-2)}{2(x-2)} = 1
</kx></h2>

<p>
	Always remember! The limit of a function represents a value that is <i>infinitely close</i> to—but <i>never reaching</i>—another value. That is why <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to 2} f(x)</kx> can be <kx>1</kx> while <kx>f(2)</kx> is <kspan><kx>\undef</kx>.</kspan> Take a look at the following examples.
</p>

<c-split>
	<figure>

		<figcaption>
			The graph of <kspan><kx>g(x)</kx>,</kspan> where <kx>g(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2</kx> except for <kx>g(1) = 1</kx> and <kspan><kx>g(2) = \undef</kx>.</kspan>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<div>
		<p>
			<kx class="lime">\lim\limits_{x \to 2} g(x) = 2</kx> while <kx class="lime">g(2) = \undef</kx> because, similar to the previous example, the graph converges on <kx>y=2</kx> as <kx>x</kx> draws ever closer to <kspan><kx>2</kx>.</kspan>
		</p>
		<p>
			<kx class="lime">\lim\limits_{x \to 0} g(x) = 0</kx> even when <kx class="lime">g(0) = 0</kx> as well, because limits still function the same even when <kx>f(c)</kx> is defined.
		</p>
		<p>
			<kx class="lime">\lim\limits_{x \to 1} g(x) = \frac{1}{2}</kx> despite the fact that <kx class="lime">g(1) = 1</kx> because the limit of a function is what it <i>approaches</i>, not what it actually <i>is</i> at <kspan><kx>f(c)</kx>.</kspan>
		</p>
	</div>
</c-split>

<p>Limits can work with infinity as well:</p>

<c-split>
	<div>
		<p>
			<kx class="cyan">\lim\limits_{x \to 0} h(x) = \infin</kx> because both branches grow faster and faster as <kx>x</kx> nears <kspan><kx>0</kx>.</kspan>
		</p>
		<p>
			<kx class="cyan">\lim\limits_{x \to \infin} h(x) = 0</kx> and <kx class="cyan">\lim\limits_{x \to -\infin} h(x) = 0</kx> because the graph is always getting closer to zero as <kx>x</kx> grows larger in either direction. Limits to positive or negative infinity are the same thing as end behavior.
		</p>
	</div>
	<figure>
		{% endraw %}
			<img src="rationalExample.png">
		{% raw %}
		<figcaption>
			The graph of <kspan><kx>h(x) = \frac{1}{16 x^2 (x+1)}</kx>,</kspan> which has vertical asymptotes at both <kx>x=-1</kx> and <kspan><kx>x=0</kx>.</kspan>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
</c-split>

<p>
	You might have noticed that <kx class="cyan">\lim\limits_{x \to -1} h(x)</kx> was skipped. This is because, as you may have guessed, there is no y-value which both sides of <kx>x=-1</kx> converge upon; the branches of the graph head in opposite directions. In cases like this where there is no limit, you would say the limit <i>does not exist</i>, written as <kx>\DNE</kx>.
</p>

<h2><kx class="cyan">
	\lim\limits_{x \to -1} h(x) = \DNE
</kx></h2>

<p>
	Everything so far has just been looking at graphs and, essentially, guessing what the limit is. The next step is actually solving for them.
