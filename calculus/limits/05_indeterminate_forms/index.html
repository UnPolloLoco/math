<h2>Undefined vs. Indeterminate</h2>

<p>
	If a value is undefined, then it has no value. If a value is indeterminate, then the value exists but is useless. Consider these two common headaches, <kx>\frac{n}{0}</kx> and <kspan><kx>\frac{0}{0}</kx>.</kspan>
</p>

<c-split class="halfsplit">
	<div>
		<p>
			<kspan><kx class="yellow">3 \div 0</kx>,</kspan> for example, is <kx class="yellow">\undef</kx> because it doesn't have an answer. After rearranging the fraction into a multiplication problem, it's clear that not even infinity can bring <kx>0x</kx> to <kspan><kx>3</kx>.</kspan>
		</p>
		<kx class="yellow">
			\begin{aligned}
				3 \div 0 &= x
				\n 
				3 &= 0x
			\end{aligned}
		</kx>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			<kx class="lime">0 \div 0</kx> is <kx class="lime">\ind</kx> because it has infinite answers, and therefore tells you nothing. Of course, <i>any</i> number multiplied by zero will be zero.
		</p>
		<kx class="lime">
			\begin{aligned}
				0 \div 0 &= x
				\n 
				0 &= 0x
			\end{aligned}
		</kx>
	</div>
</c-split>


<h2>Indeterminate Forms</h2>

<p>
	An indeterminate form is a value which carries no meaning on its own, and does not relate to the actual answer; it's like asking a limit for a number, but recieving an exquisite painting of an apple instead. If direct substitution results in an indeterminate form (e.g. <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to 4} \frac{x - 4}{x^2 - 16} = \frac{(4) - 4}{(4)^2 - 16} =</kx> <kspan><kx>\frac{0}{0}</kx>),</kspan> then the function has to be modified in order to solve the limit (e.g. <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to 4} \frac{x - 4}{x^2 - 16} = \lim\limits_{x \to 4} \frac{1}{x+4} = \frac{1}{8}</kx>).</kspan> The seven indeterminate forms are as follows:
</p>

<kx class="largeequation">
	\frac{0}{0}, \quad
	0^0, \quad
	\infin - \infin, \quad
	\frac{\infin}{\infin},
	\n
	0(\infin), \quad
	1^{\infin}, \quad
	{\infin}^0
</kx>

<p>
	All of those values have a reason for being indeterminate:

<table class="descriptions">
	<tr>
		<td><kx class="largeequation">
			\frac{0}{0}
		</td></kx>
		<td><p>
			As previously discussed, <kx>\frac{0}{0}</kx> is indeterminate because any value of <kx>x</kx> will satisfy its rearranged version <kspan><kx>0 = 0x</kx>.</kspan> There is no way to go off of <kx>\frac{0}{0}</kx> to get any helpful answer.
		</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><kx class="largeequation">
			0^0
		</td></kx>
		<td><p>
			This problem originates from conflicting exponent properties <kx>a^0 = 1</kx> and <kspan><kx>0^a = 0</kx>.</kspan> When limits are used to attempt to find a common ground, it quickly becomes apparent that <kx>0^0</kx> has several possibilities: <kx>\lim\limits_{a \to 0^+} a^0</kx> and <kx>\lim\limits_{a \to 0^+} 0^a</kx> both directly substitute to <kspan><kx>0^0</kx>,</kspan> but <kx>\lim\limits_{a \to 0^+} a^0 = 1</kx> while <kspan><kx>\lim\limits_{a \to 0^+} 0^a = 0</kx>.</kspan> Since <kx>0^0</kx> cannot be both <kx>0</kx> and <kspan><kx>1</kx>,</kspan> it's left as indeterminate.
			<br>
			Keep in mind that these are indeterminate forms of <i>limits</i>â€”it isn't a true <kx>0^0</kx>, but rather something <i>approaching</i> <kx>0</kx> to the power of something <i>approaching</i> <kspan><kx>0</kx>.</kspan> Outside of limits, <kx>0^0</kx> is often considered to be <kspan><kx>1</kx>.</kspan>

			\infin - \infin
		</td></kx>
		<td><p>
			Seeing as infinity a concept rather than a number, operating on it isn't as clean as it is with actual numbers. It's not equal to <kx>0</kx> because there's no certainty that each infinity is equivalent. The answer could be anything. An example of this would be <kspan><kx>\lim\limits_{x \to \infin} (2x - x)</kx>.</kspan>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><kx class="largeequation">
			\frac{\infin}{\infin}
		</td></kx>
		<td><p>
			This fraction has the same issue that <kx>\infin - \infin</kx> has. You can't tell how much larger one infinity is than the other, so <kx>\frac{\infin}{\infin}</kx> is pretty much worthless.
		</p></td>

	<tr>

			0(\infin)

		<td><p>
			At first, this one seems nonsensical. How could something multiplied by zero not just be zero? Consider these similar limits, <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to 0} (x \cdot \frac{1}{x}) = 1</kx> and <kspan><kx>\lim\limits_{x \to 0} (x \cdot \frac{5}{x}) = 5</kx>.</kspan> They both directly substitute to <kspan><kx>0(\infin)</kx>,</kspan> but have different values.
		</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><kx class="largeequation">
			1^{\infin}
		</td></kx>
		<td><p>
			Both <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to \infin} (1 + \frac{1}{x})^x</kx> and <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to \infin} (1 + \frac{1}{x})^{x^2}</kx> substitute to <kspan><kx>1^{\infin}</kx>,</kspan> but they equal <kx>e</kx> and <kx>\infin</kx> respectively. This discrepancy is caused by whether or not <kx>1</kx> is approached faster than <kx>\infin</kx> is.
		</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><kx class="largeequation">
			{\infin}^0
		</td></kx>
		<td><p>
			Limits <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to \infin} x^{\frac{1}{x}} = 1</kx> and <kx>\lim\limits_{x \to \infin} \big(5^x\big)^{\frac{1}{x}} = 5</kx> will both substitute to <kx>{\infin}^0</kx> even though they equal different things.

<h2>
	Summary
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<kx>\undef</kx> means no answers
	</li>
	<li>
		<kx>\ind</kx> means you can't figure out the answer, as what you are given can mean many things
	</li>
	<li>
		If direct substitution of a limit leads to an indeterminate form, then the limit's function must be modified before attempting to solve
	</li>
